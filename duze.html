        	<p>
        		The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. 
        	It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often 
       		 referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. 
    		The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat,
    		 which ranges freely and avoids human contact.
